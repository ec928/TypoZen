# Known issues

Baseline inventory of **user-visible** residual risk for the current tree.

- **Open defect-class items:** none.
- Suite-only failures belong in the harness, not here. See `docs/for-agents.md`.

## Product limits (not defects — do not “fix” by inventing precision)

### The page TOTAL is an estimate until the document has been laid out — and says so

`PageChunks` measures only the ranges the reader has visited and infers the rest from
pages-per-block. So the total moves as a long book is read. Three rules keep that honest
rather than misleading:

- **It is marked.** The indicator reads `43 / ~264` and the Go To prompt says the total is
  an estimate, until every range has been measured. The page you are *on* is always exact.
- **It never revokes a page.** A range that has not been laid out keeps the larger of its
  current and refined estimate (`setMeasured`), so an inferred total only grows. Measured
  ranges are exact, so the figure still converges on the truth.
- **The end is exact.** Dragging the scrubber fully right seeks the last *block*, not the
  last estimated page — the end of a document is knowable without any estimate.

**User expectation:** the page you are on is right; the total is marked `~` while it is
still being learned, and is exact once the document has been read through. Mark sidebar
**p N** uses the same map and can lag until its range is real.

## Fixed / mitigated (kept briefly so regressions are recognized)

### Search jumped to the wrong place when a match had no DOM range — **fixed**

Image-only path matches and other no-text-node hits used to fall back to `ranges[0]` and
scroll to the first mounted highlight (often the top of the document).

**Now:** `highlightModelMatchInMountedDom` only scrolls when `currentRange` names this
match. Image-only hits navigate via `ensureModelBlockVisible` / page map and never use
the text highlighter. Status Ln is pinned after jumps (`pinStatusLineAfterJump` + sticky
preferred when focus is outside the editor).

### Marks list active row wrong in 2-col — **fixed**

Active row used “last mark ≤ top-left block,” missing marks on the right of the spread.
**Now:** prefer marks visible on screen, then list-click pin, then last-before.

### Preview not editable after leaving a book — **fixed**

`leaveBookViewForMarkdown` set `contenteditable` while mode was still Reader, then
flipped mode without re-enabling edit. **Now:** mode first, then
`setEditorEditable(true)` for Preview; `applyViewState` re-syncs editability.

### Marks unresolved after reopen — **fixed** (re-verify if seen)

Load-order / fingerprint / hint handling for marks across book open and Marks tab.

### Tab after undo (list indent) — **mitigated**

Clear format freeze on undo/redo; list Tab prefers live selection.

---

### Hover paint erased bookmarks — **fixed**

The hover cue and the bookmark were both drawn as an inset left `box-shadow`, and the
hover rule was written more specifically, so mousing over a bookmarked paragraph in
Preview swapped its amber edge for the accent one. In Reader the "hover off" rules used
`box-shadow: none !important` / `background-color: transparent !important`, which erased
the bookmark rail *and* the arrival wash on whichever paragraph the pointer rested over.

**Now:** the gutter is a single `::before` rail owned by bookmarks, four opacities, and
there is no block-body hover cue at all. Nothing in that lane uses `!important`.

---

## Preferences (not bugs)

- **View → Block Hover:** `off` / `gutter` (default). Controls the hover *preview* only —
  a bookmark that exists is always drawn, in Reader as well as Preview.
- Search and Marks jumps share **`flashMarkFocus`** (brief amber wash, `MARK_FLASH_MS`).

---

## If something still feels wrong

1. Reproduce once with Debug HUD (Ctrl+Shift+D): sticky line, find index, mode.
2. Prefer a new entry here over reopening a “fixed” section without evidence.
3. Page-number drift on first pass through a huge book is the product limit above, not a
   regression of mark resolve or search jump.
